				<h3>Founding</h3>
				<p>In 1975 history was made on a college campus. In Kean College (now Kean Univeristy) located in Union New Jersey, the Latino Greek Movement was birthed with the goal of creating Latin Unity where nationalistic rivalry was much more common. Before then, there were no Latino fraternities in the United States and fraternal organizations primarily existed for Anglo and African-American students. The founders of Lambda Theta Phi had a vision of empowering latinos, giving them tools to make their voices heard and impart on them the value of an education</p>

				<p>While at first more of a political activist organization, soon the fraternity's brotherhood aspects were fleshed out. Thanks to the guidance of Fraternal Fathers Dr. Cayetano J. Socarras and Jose A. Quiles, who were administrators on Kean's campus, the fraternity's symbolisms and administrative framework were molded. Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity Inc. used the Conquistador as a symbol--meant to be true to the literal definition of one who conquers obstacles--and created the motto, "Chivalry Above Self." Ideals of identity, equality, scholarship, chivalry, and service were also instilled into the organization</p>
				<p>Within a few years the Fraternity was ready to expand to other campuses to spread these ideals and to do service for the Latino community. First in New Jersey, spreading first to Rutgers in 1978 forming the Beta Chapter, and crossing state borders to Connecticut, to the University of Connecticut in 1991 with the Lambda Chapter. The movement continued to grow as Lambda Theta Phi became the first Latin fraternity to be accepted into the National Interfreaternity Conference in 1992 and the Lambdas expanded more and more nationwide. In 1995 the Florida conquest begain in Phi Chapter in the University of Florida and in 1998 the Alpha Psi Chapter was founded here in the University of South Florida.</p>
